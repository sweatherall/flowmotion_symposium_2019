        "bio": "Sarah (Skip) has been teaching yoga since 2016 with a specialization in Hot Vinyasa Yoga. She brings an understanding that every body is different and yoga can be adapted to fit a person's specific needs. She instructs clients from the ages of 18-90. She enjoys the creativity of Vinyasa flow and all the possibilities for freedom of personal expression through movement and increased self-awareness. This made Acro Yoga a natural addition to her personal practice. Acro provides a playful opportunity to create movement, flow, and challenge what you are truly capable of while working with others to accomplish a mutual goal. While yoga is a very introspective practice, Acro Yoga requires clear interpersonal communication. She hopes to facilitate space to increase awareness of mind and body with each breath as it guides you throughout your own practice so you can live mindfully on and off the mat. Skip teaches weekly yoga classes at Ekah Yoga, Vibe Yoga, Hoosier Heights and Area 10 Agency on Aging. She instructs Acro Foundations at Hoosier Heights with Adam Ploshay Tuesdays at 7:00pm.",

It wasn't until 2015 that he discovered flow art and fell in love with spinning the dragon staff. After 2 years of combining his new found love for flow with his dance and choreography experience, he has gone on to perform and instruct at various festivals, concerts, private events, and local shows. While performing through flow arts is one of his biggest passions, it wasn't his first. Bryan is also well known for teaching people how to roll sushi, both in the online space and in person. Thus, he chose the performance name Sushii. You can see his sushi work online by searching Secrets of Sushi.",
