            Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which makes a person feel offended, humiliated and/or intimidated. It includes situations where a person is asked to engage in sexual activity as a condition of that person’s participation in the environment/event, as well as situations which create an environment which is hostile, intimidating or humiliating for the recipient. Sexual harassment can involve one or more incidents and actions constituting harassment may be physical, verbal and non-verbal. Examples of conduct or behaviour which constitute sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:

            Anyone can be a victim of sexual harassment, regardless of their sex and of the sex of the harasser. FlowMotion Events LLC recognises that sexual harassment may also occur between people of the same sex. What matters is that the sexual conduct is unwanted and unwelcome by the person against whom the conduct is directed.

            Anyone who is subject to sexual harassment should, if possible, inform the alleged harasser that the conduct is unwanted and unwelcome. FlowMotion Events LLC recognises that sexual harassment may occur in unequal relationships and that it may not be possible for the victim to inform the alleged harasser. If a victim cannot directly approach an alleged harasser, he/she can approach one of the designated staff members responsible for receiving complaints of sexual harassment. This person could be another volunteer who will direct the accuser to the appropriate person, a member of the admin team or an instructor who will direct the accuser to the correct party. When a designated person receives a complaint of sexual harassment, he/she will:

            <li>ensure that the victim understands the events’ procedures for dealing with the complaint</li>
            <li>discuss and agree the next steps: either informal or formal complaint, on the understanding that choosing to resolve the matter informally does not preclude the victim from pursuing a formal complaint if he/she is not satisfied with the outcome</li>

            <li>respect the choice of the victim</li>

The admin/mediator may deal with the matter him/herself, refer the matter to an internal or external investigator or refer it to a committee of three others in accordance with this policy.
